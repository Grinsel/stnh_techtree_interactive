- **Species Filter**: Filter technologies by species.
- **Tier-Level Filter**: Filter the tree to show only technologies of specific tiers.
- **Area Filter**: Filter by technology area (Physics, Society, Engineering).
- **Info Panel**: A detailed, draggable panel for clicked technologies with descriptions that go beyond the simple tooltip.
- **Shareable Links**: Generate a unique URL that saves your current filters, layout, and focused technology or even a calculated path to share your exact view.
- **History Navigation**: Use back and forward buttons to navigate through your viewing history, similar to a web browser.
- **Path & Dependency Analysis**: Right-click to select a start and end technology, then render the direct path or all prerequisites in a separate, focused view.

- **Refined Initial View**: Improvements to the initial presentation of the tree when it first loads.
- **Smart Zoom Limit**: A more intelligent zoom limit, with navigation primarily handled via the minimap.
- **Parent/Child Toggle**: Switched over to the new "Path & Dependency Analysis" feature to show selected tech dependencies in a new render window.

## ðŸ“Œ Planned Features / Roadmap

The following improvements and new features are planned:

- **Minimap**: For better navigation in the full tree view, eliminating the need for endless scrolling.
- **Rarity Filter**: A filter to distinguish between rare, common, and other technology rarities.
