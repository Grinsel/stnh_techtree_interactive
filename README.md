- **Improved Search**: The search now correctly respects species restrictions.
- **Hide Isolated Techs**: An option to hide technologies with 0 or 1 connection to reduce clutter.

- **Start-Tech View**: Select a starting technology and view only its specific progression path.

The following improvements and new features are planned:

- **Minimap**: For better navigation in the full tree view, eliminating the need for endless scrolling.
- **Info Panel**: A detailed panel for clicked technologies with descriptions that go beyond the simple tooltip.
- **Rarity Filter**: A filter to distinguish between rare, common, and other technology rarities.
- **Parent/Child Toggle**: The ability to show or hide entire branches originating from a selected node.
- **Refined Initial View**: Improvements to the initial presentation of the tree when it first loads.
- **Smart Zoom Limit**: A more intelligent zoom limit, with navigation primarily handled via the minimap.
