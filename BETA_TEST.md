# Beta Test: STNH Techtree Interactive

Welcome to the first public **beta version** of the interactive technology tree for the **Star Trek: New Horizons** mod.

## Preview Link

[https://grinsel.github.io/stnh_techtree_interactive/](https://grinsel.github.io/stnh_techtree_interactive/)

## Purpose of this Test

This release is intended for functional testing and feedback collection. We’re looking for:

- **Bugs and broken functionality** (e.g. missing or incorrect dependencies, display issues, non-functioning UI elements)
- **Suggestions for better usability**
- **Ideas for useful or innovative features**

## How to Use the Tree

The full tech tree is extremely large and not easily usable as a whole. For this reason, the **recommended approach is to use the search function**:

1. Type the name of a technology into the search bar.
2. Click on the relevant result.
3. A **focused subtree** will be displayed, showing only the relevant path around that technology.

This makes it much easier to explore specific areas of the tree without being overwhelmed.

## Known Limitations

- **Species filtering** is only functional in the **full tree view**.
- When using the **search function**, all technologies are shown **regardless of species restrictions**.

## Planned Features / Roadmap

The following features are currently in development or under consideration:

- Improved search results that respect species filters
- Minimap for better navigation of the full tree
- A dedicated information panel with detailed data about the selected technology
- Toggle to hide loose techs (with 0 or 1 connection)
- Tier and rarity filters
- Branch (Parent/Child) toggling from selected nodes
- Optimized initial view when loading the tree
- Smart zoom control with minimap for orientation
- Experimental “Start Tech” view mode (select a starting tech and see its branch only)

## Feedback Instructions

Please post your feedback in the **Closed Beta Forum**, and make sure to **tag `@Grinsel`** in your post.

Useful feedback includes:
- Technology names or IDs
- Screenshots of bugs or display issues
- Suggestions to improve navigation or functionality

Thank you for helping us improve this tool for the STNH community.
