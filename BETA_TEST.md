# Beta Test: STNH Techtree Interactive

Welcome to the **beta version** of the interactive technology tree for the **Star Trek: New Horizons** mod.

## Preview Link

## Purpose of this Test

This release is intended for functional testing and feedback collection. Weâ€™re looking for:

- **Bugs and broken functionality** (e.g. missing or incorrect dependencies, display issues, non-functioning UI elements)
- **Suggestions for better usability**
- **Ideas for useful or innovative features**

## How to Use the Tree

The full tech tree can be overwhelming. The **recommended approach is to use the search function** and the available filters to narrow down the view.

1.  **Search**: Type the name of a technology into the search bar and click the result to see a focused subtree. The search now respects species restrictions.
2.  **Filters**: Use the filters to refine the view:
    *   **Species Filter**: Restrict the tree to a specific species (most effective in full view).
    *   **Tier-Level Filter**: Show only technologies of certain tiers.
    *   **Hide Isolated Techs**: Remove techs with 0 or 1 connection to simplify the graph.
3.  **Start-Tech View**: Select a starting tech to see only its progression path.

## Known Limitations

- The **Species Filter** is currently most effective and predictable when used in the **full tree view** rather than in a filtered subtree.

## Planned Features / Roadmap

The following features are currently in development or under consideration:

- **Minimap**: For better navigation in the full tree view.
- **Rarity Filter**: A filter to distinguish between rare, common, and other tech rarities.


## Feedback Instructions

Please post your feedback in the **Closed Beta Forum**, and make sure to **tag `@Grinsel`** in your post.

Useful feedback includes:
- Technology names or IDs
- Screenshots of bugs or display issues
- Suggestions to improve navigation or functionality
